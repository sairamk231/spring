1) What is Spring?
  It is a lightweight, loosely coupled and integrated framework for developing enterprise applications in java.

2) What are the advantages of spring framework?
  Predefined Templates
  Loose Coupling
  Easy to test
  Lightweight
  Fast Development
  Powerful Abstraction
  Declarative support

3) What are the modules of spring framework?
  Test
  Spring Core Container
  AOP, Aspects and Instrumentation
  Data Access/Integration
  Web

2. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?
Definition:
IoC means Spring controls the creation and lifecycle of objects, not the developer.

IoC Containers:-
BeanFactory: Basic container, lazy initialization.
ApplicationContext: Advanced container, eager initialization, supports events, internationalization, etc

5) What is the role of IOC container in spring?
IOC container is responsible to:
create the instance
configure the instance, and
assemble the dependencies

6) What are the types of IOC container in spring?
There are two types of IOC containers in spring framework.
BeanFactory
ApplicationContext

7) What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
BeanFactory is the basic container whereas ApplicationContext is the advanced container. ApplicationContext extends the BeanFactory interface.
ApplicationContext provides more facilities than BeanFactory such as integration with spring AOP, message resource handling for i18n etc.

8) Dependency Injection (DI)
Definition: DI is a way to provide dependencies to objects rather than creating them manually.
Types of DI:-
Constructor Injection
Setter Injection
Field Injection (Annotation-based)

a) Constructor Injection
Dependencies are passed via constructor.
Best for mandatory dependencies.

b) Setter Injection
Dependencies are set via setter methods.
Best for optional dependencies.

c) Field Injection (Annotation-based)
Dependencies injected directly into fields using annotations like @Autowired.
Common in Spring Boot.
