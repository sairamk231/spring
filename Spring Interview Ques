1) What is Spring?
  It is a lightweight, loosely coupled and integrated framework for developing enterprise applications in java.

2) What are the advantages of spring framework?
  Predefined Templates
  Loose Coupling
  Easy to test
  Lightweight
  Fast Development
  Powerful Abstraction
  Declarative support

3) What are the modules of spring framework?
  Test
  Spring Core Container
  AOP, Aspects and Instrumentation
  Data Access/Integration
  Web

2. What is IoC (Inversion of Control)?
Definition:
IoC means Spring controls the creation and lifecycle of objects, not the developer.

IoC Containers:-
BeanFactory: Basic container, lazy initialization.
ApplicationContext: Advanced container, eager initialization, supports events, internationalization, etc

5) What is the role of IOC container in spring?
IOC container is responsible to:
create the instance
configure the instance, and
assemble the dependencies

6) What are the types of IOC container in spring?
There are two types of IOC containers in spring framework.
BeanFactory
ApplicationContext

7) What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?
BeanFactory is the basic container whereas ApplicationContext is the advanced container. ApplicationContext extends the BeanFactory interface.
ApplicationContext provides more facilities than BeanFactory such as integration with spring AOP, message resource handling for i18n etc.

8) Dependency Injection (DI)
Definition: DI is a way to provide dependencies to objects rather than creating them manually.
Types of DI:-
Constructor Injection
Setter Injection
Field Injection (Annotation-based)

a) Constructor Injection
Dependencies are passed via constructor.
Best for mandatory dependencies.

b) Setter Injection
Dependencies are set via setter methods.
Best for optional dependencies.

c) Field Injection (Annotation-based)
Dependencies injected directly into fields using annotations like @Autowired.
Common in Spring Boot.

🌱 Spring Core
1️⃣ Spring Beans
Definition

A Spring Bean is an object that is created, configured, and managed by the Spring IoC container.

Key Points

Managed by ApplicationContext

Defined via annotations, Java config, or XML

Supports dependency injection

Lifecycle managed by Spring

2️⃣ Bean Scopes
Definition

Bean scope defines how many instances of a bean are created and how long they live.

Types & Key Points

singleton (default) – one instance per container

prototype – new instance each request

request – one per HTTP request

session – one per HTTP session

application – one per ServletContext
⚠️ Scope ≠ thread safety

3️⃣ Bean Lifecycle
Definition
The bean lifecycle describes the creation → initialization → usage → destruction of a bean.

Key Points
Instantiation
Dependency Injection
Initialization (@PostConstruct)
Ready to use
Destruction (@PreDestroy)
Destroy not called for prototype beans

4️⃣ Autowiring
Definition
Autowiring allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into beans.
Key Points
Types: constructor, setter, field
Constructor injection is recommended
@Qualifier resolves multiple bean conflicts
Reduces boilerplate code

5️⃣ Spring Annotations
Definition
Annotations are metadata used to configure Spring behavior.

Key Points (Common Annotations)
@Component, @Service, @Repository
@Controller, @RestController
@Autowired, @Qualifier
@Configuration, @Bean
@Value

🚀 Spring Boot
6️⃣ Spring vs Spring Boot
Definition
Spring Boot is an opinionated framework built on top of Spring to simplify configuration and deployment.

Key Points
No XML configuration
Embedded servers (Tomcat)
Auto configuration
Faster development

7️⃣ Spring Boot Architecture
Definition
Architecture that enables auto-configured, standalone Spring applications.

Key Points
@SpringBootApplication
Auto Configuration
Starter Dependencies
Embedded Server
Externalized configuration

8️⃣ Starter Dependencies
Definition
Predefined dependency bundles that simplify dependency management.
Key Points
Reduce version conflicts

Examples:
spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
spring-boot-starter-security
Can exclude unwanted dependencies

9️⃣ Auto Configuration
Definition:
Automatically configures Spring beans based on classpath, properties, and conditions.

Key Points:
Enabled by @EnableAutoConfiguration
Conditional annotations (@ConditionalOnClass)
Can be disabled or customized

🔟 Application Properties / YML
Definition:
External configuration files for application behavior.

Key Points:
application.properties or application.yml
Supports environment-specific configs
Property hierarchy & priority order
YML is more readable for complex configs

1️⃣1️⃣ REST API Development
Definition:
Developing stateless APIs using HTTP methods.

Key Points:
Uses @RestController
HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
JSON as standard data format
Follows REST principles

1️⃣2️⃣ Exception Handling (Spring Boot)
Definition:
Centralized way to handle exceptions in REST APIs.

Key Points:
@RestControllerAdvice
@ExceptionHandler
Global error handling
Clean and consistent responses

1️⃣3️⃣ Validation
Definition
Validates request data using Bean Validation (JSR-380).

Key Points:
Annotations: @NotNull, @Size, @Email
Enabled using @Valid
Reduces manual checks
Integrated with REST APIs

1️⃣4️⃣ Actuator
Definition

Provides production-ready monitoring endpoints.

Key Points:
Health checks
Metrics
Environment info
Needs security in production
Endpoints under /actuator

1️⃣5️⃣ Profiles
Definition:
Profiles allow environment-specific configurations.

Key Points:
dev, test, prod
Activate via properties or command line
Multiple profiles can be active
Avoids config duplication

🌐 Microservices (Basic)
1️⃣6️⃣ Monolithic vs Microservices
Definition:
Architectural styles for application development.

Key Points:
Monolithic → single codebase
Microservices → independent services
Microservices scale independently
Loose coupling

1️⃣7️⃣ RESTful Web Services
Definition:
Web services based on REST principles.
Key Points
Stateless
Resource-oriented
Uses HTTP methods
Lightweight communication

1️⃣8️⃣ Spring Boot with Microservices
Definition
Using Spring Boot to build independent, deployable microservices.

Key Points:
Fast startup
Independent DB per service
Easy REST integration
Cloud-ready

1️⃣9️⃣ Inter-Service Communication
Definition
Communication between microservices.
Key Points:
Synchronous: REST (RestTemplate, WebClient)
Asynchronous: Messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
Avoid tight coupling
Handle failures gracefully
