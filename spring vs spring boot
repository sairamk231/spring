🌱 Relationship Between Spring & Spring Boot
| Term                 | Meaning                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Framework** | Core framework providing IoC, DI, AOP, MVC, Security, etc.                         |
| **Spring Boot**      | A **framework built on top of Spring Framework** to simplify configuration & setup |
🔍 Why the Confusion Happens

People often say “Spring Boot Framework” because:
Spring itself is a framework
Boot adds automation, defaults, and tooling
So they casually append the word framework
But officially, the name is just Spring Boot.

🧠 Key Point for Interviews

❓ Is Spring Boot and Spring Boot framework same?
✅ Yes. Spring Boot itself is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework.

You can also say:
“Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that simplifies Spring application development.”

🆚 Spring Framework vs Spring Boot (Quick)
| Aspect           | Spring Framework | Spring Boot         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Configuration    | Manual           | Auto-configured     |
| Setup            | Complex          | Very fast           |
| Server           | External         | Embedded            |
| Boilerplate      | High             | Minimal             |
| Production Ready | Extra setup      | Built-in (Actuator) |


🌱 Spring vs Spring Boot
1️⃣ Spring Framework

Spring is a core Java framework that provides infrastructure support for building enterprise applications.

2️⃣ Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features.

🔹 What is Spring?

Spring focuses on flexibility and control.

Main Features:

Inversion of Control (IoC)
Dependency Injection (DI)
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
Spring MVC (Web)
Spring JDBC / ORM / JPA
Spring Security
Spring Transactions

Characteristics:

Manual configuration (XML / Java / annotations)
External application server required (Tomcat, JBoss)
More boilerplate code
More control, less opinionated

🔹 What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot focuses on simplicity and speed.
Main Features:
Auto-configuration
Starter dependencies
Embedded servers (Tomcat by default)
Production-ready tools (Actuator)
Opinionated defaults

Characteristics:

Minimal configuration
No need for external server
Faster project setup
Ideal for microservices & REST APIs

| Feature          | Spring            | Spring Boot                |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Type             | Core framework    | Framework on top of Spring |
| Configuration    | Manual            | Auto-configured            |
| Server           | External required | Embedded                   |
| Boilerplate      | More              | Very less                  |
| Startup Time     | Slower            | Faster                     |
| Microservices    | Complex           | Best choice                |
| Production Tools | Manual            | Built-in (Actuator)        |

🧠 Interview One-Line Answers

What is Spring?
👉 Spring is a Java framework that provides core infrastructure like IoC, DI, AOP, and transaction management.

What is Spring Boot?
👉 Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies application development using auto-configuration and embedded servers.

Is Spring Boot replacing Spring?
👉 ❌ No. Spring Boot uses Spring internally.

Can Spring Boot work without Spring?
👉 ❌ No. Spring Boot depends on Spring Framework.

✅ When to Use What?
Use Spring:
Legacy enterprise applications
When fine-grained configuration control is needed
XML-heavy existing systems

Use Spring Boot:
New applications
REST APIs & microservices
Cloud-native applications
Faster development & deployment

🔑 Final Summary

Spring provides features. Spring Boot makes them easy to use.
