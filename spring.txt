✅ Next Steps (Optional)
If you want, I can:
Convert this into detailed notes with code examples

Provide Spring interview questions (4–6 yrs experience)

Explain real-time project usage

Give Spring → Spring Boot mapping

Just tell me what you want next 👍

is spring boot and spring boot framework are samme

Yes — they are the same in normal usage. ✅
There is no separate product called “Spring Boot Framework”.

✔️ Correct Understanding

Spring Boot is the official framework provided by the Spring team to simplify building Spring applications.

So when people say:

Spring Boot
Spring Boot framework

👉 they are referring to the same thing.

🌱 Relationship Between Spring & Spring Boot
| Term                 | Meaning                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spring Framework** | Core framework providing IoC, DI, AOP, MVC, Security, etc.                         |
| **Spring Boot**      | A **framework built on top of Spring Framework** to simplify configuration & setup |
🔍 Why the Confusion Happens

People often say “Spring Boot Framework” because:
Spring itself is a framework
Boot adds automation, defaults, and tooling
So they casually append the word framework
But officially, the name is just Spring Boot.

🧠 Key Point for Interviews

❓ Is Spring Boot and Spring Boot framework same?
✅ Yes. Spring Boot itself is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework.

You can also say:
“Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that simplifies Spring application development.”

🌱 Spring vs Spring Boot
1️⃣ Spring Framework

Spring is a core Java framework that provides infrastructure support for building enterprise applications.

2️⃣ Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies development by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features.

🔹 What is Spring?

Spring focuses on flexibility and control.

Main Features:

Inversion of Control (IoC)
Dependency Injection (DI)
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
Spring MVC (Web)
Spring JDBC / ORM / JPA
Spring Security
Spring Transactions

Characteristics:

Manual configuration (XML / Java / annotations)
External application server required (Tomcat, JBoss)
More boilerplate code
More control, less opinionated

🔹 What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot focuses on simplicity and speed.
Main Features:
Auto-configuration
Starter dependencies
Embedded servers (Tomcat by default)
Production-ready tools (Actuator)
Opinionated defaults

Characteristics:

Minimal configuration
No need for external server
Faster project setup
Ideal for microservices & REST APIs
